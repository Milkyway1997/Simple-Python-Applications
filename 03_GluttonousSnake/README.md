# Gluttonous Snake
This application is not used for handling Excel files.  It is a very simple game.

The purpose of creating this game is for me to learn and explore the "PySimpleGui" library.

※ The program's core and basic codes are from (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8DGP9p2LY&t=8987s&ab_channel=ClearCode) Snake part. 

※ I added some new rules to the game and created a game menu that allows players to pause the game, retry the game, adjust the moving speed of the snake, etc.
